# Subtitle: From ghosted developers to global infrastructure

I didn’t build BEAVERLY® because I wanted to join the “AI startup” bandwagon. I built it because I was desperate. Desperate for freedom. Desperate for a system that didn’t keep me chained to screens, stressed out by charts, and left behind by the tools that only seemed designed for a privileged few… with nothing but a MiFi, sleepless nights, and AI co-pilots as my partners.

And honestly? I was broke.

Not “budget tight” broke; *sell-my-phone-four-times* broke. I ended up phoneless, running life with just a MiFi, an epileptic power supply here in Nigeria and a PC. Every kobo mattered. Every mistake stung. I hired developers who either did the past projects halfway or took money and ghosted. I restarted more times than I can count. But I refused to quit. If anything, the hardship made me more relentless.

So I turned to ChatGPT and Claude. Not as a gimmick, but as my partner. It was the only reason a non-traditional coder like me could build something this big. With AI as my co-pilot, line by line, failure by failure, I kept pushing until BEAVERLY® became real.



### The spark: augmentation, not replacement

I didn’t set out to build a machine that replaces traders, wealth managers, or fintech platforms. That’s not the dream of GenAI.

The dream is **augmentation**.
The dream is **freedom**.

BEAVERLY® is about handling the repetitive execution work so humans can focus on higher-value things; systems, creativity, and, well… living.

Manual traders shouldn’t be chained to screens for hours. Everyday people shouldn’t feel like finance is a gated castle they’ll never enter. Institutions shouldn’t have to fight with clunky systems that frustrate users instead of engaging them.

I wanted to bring the markets closer to *everyone*; in a way that’s designed for them to thrive.



### What BEAVERLY® really is

BEAVERLY® is the **Autonomous Execution Infrastructure for Wealth**.

That might sound big, but it breaks down into two clear layers:

* **CHILLA™**: your wealth co-pilot. Fully autonomous, yet approachable. It’s designed to give everyday people a chill, accessible experience with the markets. Plug it in, step back, and let complexity fade away.

* **M-II™ (Market Infra Intelligence)**: the execution intelligence infrastructure. This is the powerhouse that does the heavy lifting, the engine that institutions, brokers, and fintech platforms can license to boost client engagement, drive smoother operations, and expand access.

CHILLA™ is for *everyone*.
M-II™ is for the institutions powering them.

Together, they make BEAVERLY® not just another app, but a foundation; a system that augments humans and expands prosperity in the online financial markets.


### From struggle to vision

When I was sitting there with no phone, just my MiFi and PC, epileptic power supply + 3am commits, wondering if this dream would ever become real, sleeping from 7am to 1pm daily for four months straight, I held on to one belief: **the markets should be for all of us, and I felt chosen to do it.**

Not just for the “pros” with their ten monitors. Not just for the privileged with wealth managers on call. Not just for the lucky few with access to advanced systems. Not just for the "financially literate" online gurus.

I wanted to build an infrastructure that finally levels the field. A way for anyone who believes in the prosperity of the online financial markets to access it; in a form designed for them to succeed and experience freedom.

That’s BEAVERLY®.


### Not a Solo Journey

As much as I carried this stubborn dream, I wasn’t alone.

**Kolawole Oyedeji**, our CISO (Chief Information Security Officer), came in with both resources and a mission: to make sure BEAVERLY® wasn’t just functional, but secure enough to be trusted by anyone, anywhere. Before we could even think about scaling, he fought to lock down our foundation.

And then there’s **God’sfavour Ameachi** — our Business Development Manager, but honestly I've renamed that role as our Chief Business Officer. While I was buried in code, sleepless nights, and rebuilding after failed attempts, he was raising the little checks that literally kept us breathing. He carried the business side when I couldn’t even lift my head to pitch.

Without them, BEAVERLY® wouldn’t be standing. This isn’t just my story; it’s ours.



### Why I built BEAVERLY®

I built BEAVERLY® because I refused to accept that markets had to stay complicated, exclusive, and exhausting.

I built it because I knew AI could finally make this vision accessible, not just to me, but to millions of people like me who need assistants that fit into their lives.

I built it because freedom shouldn’t be a privilege.

I built it because I wanted to live in a fully autonomous future that we are all headed toward, and someone had to build that future we'd all enjoy.

So yes, BEAVERLY® is my stubborn dream turned real; I've been trying to bring this to reality since 2021. 

It’s my story of failing, falling, selling my phone four times, going hungry and still getting back up. 

But more than that, it’s an infrastructure for anyone who believes in the future of online financial markets; a future that’s open, thriving, and built for everyone.

Welcome to BEAVERLY®. Welcome to the CHILL side.

This is not just my story; it’s our story of building a freer, more inclusive future for everyone.
