![Chilla AI Wealth Co-Pilot - Futuristic Financial Interface](/images/ai_hologram_financia_8c8d34d1.jpg)

Chilla is an **AI-powered wealth co-pilot** running on an autonomous wealth infrastructure called **M-II**. It's designed to quietly work for you in the background, letting you focus on life while it handles the market.

## Getting Started

When you create a Chilla account and sign in:

1. **Connect your broker** – Create from the available options, or connect an existing account with that broker if you already have one.
2. **Activate Chilla** – Once connected, Chilla runs whether you're logged in or not.

Chilla works **24/7 in the background**, so you never have to worry about monitoring it; unless you manually disconnect it.

## More Than a Trading Bot

![AI Co-Pilot vs Simple Trading Bot - Intelligence Comparison](/images/ai_vs_robot_comparis_732ed252.jpg)

Chilla is often called a trading bot; but it's actually much more than that.

* **A traditional trading bot** tells you returns and performance.
* **Chilla** is a super-intelligent decision maker, running multiple strategies across different market conditions, and can connect to multiple brokers simultaneously on paid tiers.

Because it's a tool, **we don't promise returns or performance**. Chilla is loyal and intentional: you authorize it to work, and it does, until you cancel.

## How Chilla Trades

![AI Risk Evaluation - Safe and Intentional Trading](/images/ai_risk_evaluation_f_51941c2b.jpg)

Chilla is **picky and intentional**. You won't see dozens of trades every day. On average, you might see **1–4 trades/orders per month**, depending on the market you allow Chilla to handle. It's not flashy, but it's dependable.

We've engineered Chilla to **handle risk better than humans can**. You might have a few losing trades here and there; that's just market randomness, not a reflection of Chilla's intelligence.

## Why Chilla is Different

Chilla is more than a trading bot; it's a **long-term companion for your financial journey**:

* Focuses on **steady growth** rather than short-term excitement.
* Operates **autonomously**, freeing you from constant monitoring.
* Designed for **safety and intentionality**, reducing unnecessary risk.
* Lets you **Chill** while it quietly executes its strategies.

All you need to do is **connect your account** and let Chilla do its thing. Watch its execution footprints over **3–6 months**, and you'll start seeing how it works steadily in the background.

Chilla is here for **the long game**, helping you improve your life experiences while quietly working for you. You just chill. Chilla works.

## From ghosted developers to global infrastructure

![Hero Image - Relaxing with Trading Technology](https://blog.beaverlyai.com/generated_images/Person_relaxing_with_trading_tech_e20abb04.png)

I didn't build BEAVERLY® because I wanted to join the "AI startup" bandwagon. I built it because I was desperate. Desperate for freedom. Desperate for a system that didn't keep me chained to screens, stressed out by charts, and left behind by the tools that only seemed designed for a privileged few… with nothing but a MiFi, sleepless nights, and fire on my chest.

And honestly? I was broke.

> **"Not 'budget tight' broke; sell-my-phone-four-times broke."**

I ended up phoneless, running life with just a MiFi, an epileptic power supply here in Nigeria and a PC. Every kobo mattered. Every mistake stung. I wasn’t even a developer when I started. I hired developers, but many ghosted or left projects half-done. 

Eventually, I realized I had no option but to learn and build it myself — as the only developer among my founding team. Line by line, mistake by mistake, I taught myself to code while building Beaverly from the ground up. The hardship didn’t break me; it made me more relentless.

So I turned to ChatGPT and Claude — not as gimmicks, but as assistants. They helped me accelerate my learning curve. I wasn’t a traditional coder, but with AI as my co-pilot, I was able to debug, learn, and push forward faster than I could have alone. That’s how a first-time developer built enterprise-grade, secure infrastructure in just four months.

## The spark: augmentation, not replacement

![Human AI Collaboration Diagram](https://blog.beaverlyai.com/generated_images/Human_AI_collaboration_diagram_8bd2fa87.png)

I didn't set out to build a machine that replaces traders, wealth managers, or fintech platforms. That's not the dream of GenAI.

The dream is **augmentation**.
The dream is **freedom**.

BEAVERLY® is about handling the repetitive execution work so humans can focus on higher-value things; systems, creativity, and, well… living.

Manual traders shouldn't be chained to screens for hours. Everyday people shouldn't feel like finance is a gated castle they'll never enter. Institutions shouldn't have to fight with clunky systems that frustrate users instead of engaging them.

I wanted to bring the markets closer to *everyone*; in a way that's designed for them to thrive.

## What BEAVERLY® really is

BEAVERLY® is the **Autonomous Execution Infrastructure for Wealth**.

That might sound big, but it breaks down into two clear layers:

### CHILLA™: Your Wealth Co-Pilot

![Chilla Dashboard Interface](https://blog.beaverlyai.com/Untitled%20design_1757799377189.png)

**CHILLA™**: your wealth co-pilot. Fully autonomous, yet approachable. It's designed to give everyday people a chill, accessible experience with the markets. Plug it in, step back, and let complexity fade away.

### M-II™: Market Intelligence Infrastructure

**M-II™ (Market Infra Intelligence)**: the execution intelligence infrastructure. This is the powerhouse that does the heavy lifting, the engine that institutions, brokers, and fintech platforms can license to boost client engagement, drive smoother operations, and expand access.

CHILLA™ is for *everyone*.
M-II™ is for the institutions powering them.

And here’s the key difference: **Chilla isn’t another risky trading bot.** It connects safely to your broker, never touches your funds, and never promises ROI. It’s automation with boundaries — the chill way to let AI handle the boring, repeatable work while you live.

Together, they make BEAVERLY® not just another app, but a foundation; a system that augments humans and expands prosperity in the online financial markets.

## From struggle to vision

![Symbolic struggle image](https://blog.beaverlyai.com/generated_images/Late_night_vision_and_struggle_5638c672.png)

When I was sitting there with no phone, just my MiFi and PC, epileptic power supply + 3am commits, wondering if this dream would ever become real, sleeping from 7am to 1pm daily for four months straight, I held on to one belief: **the markets should be for all of us, and I felt chosen to do it.**

> *The irony is, building what became Beaverly wasn’t supposed to be a one-man job. By every industry estimate, a build like this would normally take a team that looks like this:*

> * *1 senior backend engineer for execution infra & broker integrations*
> * *1 quant / quant developer for strategies and backtesting*
> * *1 frontend/product engineer for dashboard and onboarding*
> * *1 product manager/designer for flow & compliance coordination*
> * *DevOps / SRE support, at least part-time*
> * *And a data scientist to even begin exploring adaptive models*
> * *Plus a veteran security/compliance lead to pass audits (that’s where Kolawole came in).*

> *Instead? It was just me. I wasn’t even a developer when I started. I had to become the backend, the frontend, the quant, the product manager, and the DevOps. I compressed an entire team into one stubborn human — at the cost of my health. At one point, I fell sick for two weeks from the grind. But I kept pushing. And by the time Kolawole locked down our security and Godsfavour kept the business side alive, Beaverly had gone from a desperate idea to a working, audited system.*


![Struggle meme](https://blog.beaverlyai.com/images_1757777062410.jfif)

Not just for the "pros" with their ten monitors. Not just for the privileged with wealth managers on call. Not just for the lucky few with access to advanced systems. Not just for the "financially literate" online gurus.

I wanted to build an infrastructure that finally levels the field. A way for anyone who believes in the prosperity of the online financial markets to access it; in a form designed for them to succeed and experience freedom.

That's BEAVERLY®.

## Not a Solo Journey

![Beaverly Founders](https://blog.beaverlyai.com/Beaverly_founders_1757777062410.png)
*Moses Olabode (left), Kolawole Oyedeji (middle), God'sfavour Amaechi (right)*

As much as I carried this stubborn dream, I wasn't alone.

**Kolawole Oyedeji**, our CISO (Chief Information Security Officer), came in with resources, veteran experience and a mission: to make sure BEAVERLY® wasn't just functional, but secure enough to be trusted by anyone, anywhere. Before we could even think about scaling, he fought to lock down our foundation.

And then there's **God'sfavour Ameachi** — our Business Development Manager, but honestly I've renamed that role as our Chief Business Officer. While I was buried in code, sleepless nights, and rebuilding after failed attempts, he was raising the little checks that literally kept us breathing. He carried the business side when I couldn't even lift my head to pitch.

Without them, BEAVERLY® wouldn't be standing. This isn't just my story; it's ours.

## Why I built BEAVERLY®

I built BEAVERLY® because I refused to accept that markets had to stay complicated, exclusive, and exhausting.

I built it because I knew AI could finally make this vision accessible, not just to me, but to millions of people like me who need assistants that fit into their lives.

I built it because freedom shouldn't be a privilege.

I built it because I wanted to live in a fully autonomous future that we are all headed toward, and someone had to build that future we'd all enjoy.

So yes, BEAVERLY® is my stubborn dream turned real; I've been trying to bring this to reality since 2021. 

It’s my story of failing, falling, selling my phone four times, going hungry — and still teaching myself to code, still building, still getting back up until Beaverly was real. 

But more than that, it's an infrastructure for anyone who believes in the future of online financial markets; a future that's open, thriving, and built for everyone.

Welcome to BEAVERLY®. Welcome to the CHILL side.

This is not just my story; it's our story of building a freer, more inclusive future for everyone.
