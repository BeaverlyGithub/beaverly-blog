# How Does Chilla Work?

Chilla is an **AI-powered wealth co-pilot** running on an autonomous wealth infrastructure called **M-II**. It's designed to quietly work for you in the background, letting you focus on life while it handles the market.

## Getting Started

When you create a Chilla account and sign in:

1. **Connect your broker** – Create from the available options, or connect an existing account with that broker if you already have one.
2. **Activate Chilla** – Once connected, Chilla runs whether you're logged in or not.

Chilla works **24/7 in the background**, so you never have to worry about monitoring it; unless you manually disconnect it.

## More Than a Trading Bot

Chilla is often called a trading bot, but it’s actually much more than that.

* **A traditional trading bot** tells you returns and performance.
* **Chilla** is a super-intelligent decision maker, running multiple strategies across different market conditions and connecting to multiple brokers simultaneously on paid tiers.

Chilla delivers personalized experiences across markets and brokers, which means it **does not promise returns or performance**. You authorize it to work, and it does; faithfully and continuously, until you cancel. 

We do, however, disclose average backtest performance for each market Chilla supports on our website. This gives you an overview of expected outcomes, but real-world results depend on your broker and market conditions.


## How Chilla Trades

![AI Risk Evaluation - Safe and Intentional Trading](/images/ai_risk_evaluation_f_51941c2b.jpg)

Chilla is **picky and intentional**. You won't see dozens of trades every day. On average, you might see **1–4 trades/orders per month**, depending on the market you allow Chilla to handle. It's not flashy, but it's dependable.

We've engineered Chilla to **handle risk better than humans can**. You might have a few losing trades here and there; that's just market randomness, not a reflection of Chilla's intelligence.

## Why Chilla is Different

Chilla is more than a trading bot; it's a **long-term companion for your financial journey**:

* Focuses on **steady growth** rather than short-term excitement.
* Operates **autonomously**, freeing you from constant monitoring.
* Designed for **safety and intentionality**, reducing unnecessary risk.
* Let's you connect any broker, anywhere, anytime.
* Lets you **Chill** while it quietly executes its strategies.

All you need to do is **connect your account** and let Chilla do its thing. Watch its execution footprints over **3–6 months**, and you'll start seeing how it works steadily in the background.

Chilla is here for **the long game**, helping you improve your life experiences while quietly working for you. You just chill. Chilla works.
