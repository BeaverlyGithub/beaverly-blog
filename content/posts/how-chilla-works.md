# How Does Chilla Work?

Chilla is your **market co-pilot** running on an intelligent automation infrastructure called **M-II**. It's designed to quietly automate your instructions in the background, letting you focus on life while it handles automation with discipline.

## Getting Started

When you create a Chilla account and sign in:

1. **Connect your broker** – Securely link your broker account (like Deriv, Binance, or others).
2. **Set your instructions** – Choose your automation behaviour, pick your markets, and set your risk boundaries.
3. **Activate** – Once you authorize, Chilla automates within your instructions whether you're logged in or not.

Chilla works **24/7 in the background**, automating your instructions with zero emotional interference—until you pause or revoke.

## Your Instructions. Chilla's Automation.

Chilla isn't a traditional trading bot that makes decisions for you. It's an **automation co-pilot** that automates within your boundaries.

* **You decide**: Pick your automation behaviour, select your markets, set your risk cap.
* **Chilla automates**: Monitors 24/7, automates within your instructions with zero emotion or bias.
* **You stay in control**: Pause, adjust, or revoke anytime. Your funds stay in your broker account—always.

Chilla doesn't recommend strategies or promise outcomes. It simply automates what you instruct, faithfully and continuously, across multiple markets and brokers (on paid tiers).

We share temperament history for each behaviour in-app—not as guarantees, but as transparency. Real results depend on your broker, market conditions, and the instructions you set.


## How Chilla Automates Intelligently

Chilla is **disciplined**. It waits for the right pattern match within your chosen behaviour.

Chilla follows your risk boundaries strictly. Losses happen—markets are unpredictable—but Chilla won't override your caps or chase hype. It automates within the rules you set, period.

## Why Chilla is Different

Chilla is built as an **automation infrastructure**, not a decision-making platform:

* **You remain in control**: All behaviours, markets, and risk caps are set by you.
* **Chilla automates with discipline**: No emotional pressure, no bias, no FOMO.
* **Broker-agnostic**: Connect Deriv, Binance, or other brokers. Your funds never leave your account.
* **24/7 monitoring**: Chilla doesn't sleep, so you can.
* **Transparent automation footprints**: See what Chilla did and why, in plain language.

Just connect your broker, set your instructions, and step back. Review automation footprints over **3–6 months** to see how Chilla maintains discipline in the background.

Chilla is built for the **long game**—helping you participate in markets without the burnout. You just chill. Chilla works.
