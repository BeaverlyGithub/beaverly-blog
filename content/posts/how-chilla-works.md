# How Chilla Works

![Chilla - Your AI-Powered Wealth Co-Pilot](/images/ai_digital_assistant_3a3a0ae5.jpg)

Chilla is an **AI-powered wealth co-pilot** running on an autonomous wealth infrastructure called **M-II**. It's designed to quietly grow your wealth in the background, letting you focus on life while it handles the market.

## Getting Started

When you create a Chilla account and sign in:

1. **Connect your broker** – Pick from the available options, or connect an account if you already have one.
2. **Activate Chilla** – Once connected, Chilla runs whether you're logged in or not.

Chilla works **24/7 in the background**, so you never have to worry about monitoring it; unless you manually disconnect it.

## More Than a Trading Bot

Chilla is often called a trading bot; but it's actually much more than that.

* **A traditional trading bot** tells you returns and performance.
* **Chilla** is a super-intelligent decision maker, running multiple strategies across different market conditions, and can connect to multiple brokers simultaneously on paid tiers.

Because it's a tool, **we don't promise returns or performance**. Chilla is loyal and intentional: you authorize it to work, and it does, until you cancel.

## How Chilla Trades

Chilla is **picky and intentional**. You won't see dozens of trades every day. On average, you might see **1–4 trades/orders per month**, depending on the market you allow Chilla to handle. It's not flashy, but it's dependable.

We've engineered Chilla to **handle risk better than humans can**. You might have a few losing trades here and there; that's just market randomness, not a reflection of Chilla's intelligence.

## Why Chilla is Different

Chilla is more than a trading bot; it's a **long-term companion for your financial journey**:

* Focuses on **steady growth** rather than short-term excitement.
* Operates **autonomously**, freeing you from constant monitoring.
* Designed for **safety and intentionality**, reducing unnecessary risk.
* Lets you **Chill** while it quietly executes its strategies.

All you need to do is **connect your account** and let Chilla do its thing. Watch its execution footprints over **3–6 months**, and you'll start seeing how it works steadily in the background.

Chilla is here for **the long game**, helping you improve your life experiences while quietly growing your wealth. You just chill. Chilla works.
