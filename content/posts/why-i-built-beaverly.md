# Why I Built BEAVERLY®
## From ghosted developers to global infrastructure

![Hero Image - Relaxing with Trading Technology](https://blog.beaverlyai.com/generated_images/Person_relaxing_with_trading_tech_e20abb04.png)

I didn't build BEAVERLY® because I wanted to join the "AI startup" bandwagon. I built it because I was desperate. Desperate for freedom. Desperate for a system that didn't keep me chained to screens, stressed out by charts, and left behind by the tools that only seemed designed for a privileged few… with nothing but a MiFi, sleepless nights, and fire on my chest

And honestly? I was broke.

> **"Not 'budget tight' broke; sell-my-phone-four-times broke."**

I ended up phoneless, running life with just a MiFi, an epileptic power supply here in Nigeria and a PC. Every kobo mattered. Every mistake stung. I wasn’t even a developer when I started. I hired developers, but many ghosted or left projects half-done. 

Eventually, I realized I had no option but to learn and build it myself — as the only developer among my founding team. Line by line, mistake by mistake, I taught myself to code while building Beaverly from the ground up. The hardship didn’t break me; it made me more relentless.

So I turned to ChatGPT and Claude — not as gimmicks, but as assistants. They helped me accelerate my learning curve. I wasn’t a traditional coder, but with AI as my co-pilot, I was able to debug, learn, and push forward faster than I could have alone. That’s how a first-time developer built enterprise-grade, secure infrastructure in just four months.

## The spark: automation, not replacement

![Human AI Collaboration Diagram](https://blog.beaverlyai.com/generated_images/Human_AI_collaboration_diagram_8bd2fa87.png)

I didn't set out to build a machine that replaces people or makes decisions for them. That's not the dream of automation.

The dream is **automation without exhaustion**.
The dream is **freedom from the screen**.

BEAVERLY® is about handling the repetitive automation work so humans can focus on higher-value things: strategy, life, and well… actually living.

Participants shouldn't be chained to screens for hours. Everyday people shouldn't feel like market participation is a gated castle they'll never enter. And no one should have to choose between discipline and burnout.

I wanted to bring disciplined market participation to *everyone*—in a way that's designed for them to succeed without the stress.

## What BEAVERLY® really is

BEAVERLY® is the **Orchestration Layer for Modern Finance.**.

That might sound big, but it breaks down into two clear layers:

### CHILLA™: Your Market Co-Pilot

![Chilla Interface Mockup](https://blog.beaverlyai.com/generated_images/Chilla_trading_interface_mockup_bf377fd7.png)

**CHILLA™**: your market co-pilot. Non-discretionary, yet powerful. It's designed to give everyday people a chill, accessible way to automate their market instructions. You set the rules, Chilla automates them faithfully.

### M-II™: Market Intelligence Infrastructure

**M-II™ (Market Infra Intelligence)**: the automation engine powering everything. This is the infrastructure that does the heavy lifting—the engine that institutions, brokers, and fintech platforms can license to offer disciplined automation to their users.
CHILLA™ is for *everyone*.
M-II™ is for the institutions empowering them.

And here's the key difference: **Chilla isn't a decision-making bot.** It connects to your broker, never touches your funds, and never makes choices for you. You instruct, Chilla automates. That's it.

Together, they make BEAVERLY® not just another app, but an infrastructure—a system that enables disciplined automation without requiring people to stay glued to screens.

## From struggle to vision

![Symbolic struggle image](https://blog.beaverlyai.com/generated_images/Late_night_vision_and_struggle_5638c672.png)

When I was sitting there with no phone, just my MiFi and PC, epileptic power supply + 3am commits, wondering if this dream would ever become real, sleeping from 7am to 1pm daily for four months straight, I held on to one belief: **the markets should be for all of us, and I felt chosen to do it.**

> *The irony is, building what became Beaverly wasn’t supposed to be a one-man job. By every industry estimate, a build like this would normally take a team that looks like this:*
>
> * *1 senior backend engineer for automation infra & broker integrations*
> * *1 quant / quant developer for strategies and backtesting*
> * *1 frontend/product engineer for dashboard and onboarding*
> * *1 product manager/designer for flow & compliance coordination*
> * *1 brand designer for UX and positioning*
> * *DevOps / SRE support, at least part-time*
> * *And a data scientist to even begin exploring adaptive models*
> * *Plus a veteran security/compliance lead to pass audits (that’s where Kolawole came in).*
>
> *Instead? It was just me. I wasn’t even a developer when I started. I had to become the backend, the frontend, the quant, the product manager, and the DevOps. I compressed an entire team into one stubborn human — at the cost of my health. At one point, I fell sick for two weeks from the grind. But I kept pushing. And by the time Kolawole locked down our security and Godsfavour kept the business side alive, Beaverly had gone from a desperate idea to a working, audited system.*


![Struggle meme](https://blog.beaverlyai.com/images_1757777062410.jfif)

Not just for the "pros" with their ten monitors. Not just for the privileged with wealth managers on call. Not just for the lucky few with access to advanced systems. Not just for the "financially literate" online gurus.

I wanted to build an infrastructure that finally levels the field. A way for anyone who believes in the prosperity of the online financial markets to access it; in a form designed for them to succeed and experience freedom.

That's BEAVERLY®.

## Not 100% a Solo Journey

As much as I carried this stubborn dream, I wasn't alone.

**Kolawole Oyedeji**, our CISO (Chief Information Security Officer), came in with resources, veteran experience and a mission: to make sure BEAVERLY® wasn't just functional, but secure enough to be trusted by anyone, anywhere. Before we could even think about scaling, he fought to lock down our foundation.

And then there's **God'sfavour Ameachi** — our Business Development Manager, but honestly I've renamed that role as our Chief Business Officer. While I was buried in code, sleepless nights, and rebuilding after failed attempts, he was raising the little checks that literally kept us breathing. He carried the business side when I couldn't even lift my head to pitch.

Without them, BEAVERLY® wouldn't be standing. This isn't just my story; it's ours.

## Why I built BEAVERLY®

I built BEAVERLY® because I refused to accept that market participation had to stay complicated, exclusive, and exhausting.

I built it because I knew it could finally make disciplined automation accessible—not just to me, but to millions of people who want to participate without the burnout.

I built it because control shouldn't require constant vigilance.

I built it because I wanted to live in a future where technology serves us, not replaces us—and someone had to build that infrastructure.

So yes, BEAVERLY® is my stubborn dream turned real. I've been trying to bring this to reality since 2021. 

It’s my story of failing, falling, selling my phone four times, going hungry — and still teaching myself to code, still building, still getting back up until Beaverly was real.

But more than that, it's an infrastructure for anyone who believes in the future of market participation—a future where automation works *for* you, not *instead* of you.

Welcome to BEAVERLY®. Welcome to the CHILL side.

This is not just my story; it's our story of building an intelligent automation infrastructure that puts people first.
